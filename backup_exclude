# Example backup_exclude
# based on http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2008/05/10/beginner-to-beginner-rsync-exclude-from/
# let's assume our backup root is the home folder
# ls /home/user
#   Videos/ Pictures/ Documents/
# ls /home/user/Documents
#    Paper2010 Paper2011/ Groceries/
# Let's assume you want to save only things in Documents, but not the Groceries folder
# Then let's exclude the groceries and all its contents first (order is important)
- Documents/Groceries/***
# Then let's add the Documents folder and it's contents
+ Documents/
+ Documents/***
# Finally let's exlude everything else
